title: Custom UI Themes

Beginning with the 2019.1 release, custom UI Themes are supported by IntelliJ IDEA.
Custom UI Themes give designers control of the appearance of built-in IntelliJ IDEA UI elements. 
[Creating a new UI element](/user_interface_components/user_interface_components.md) for a plugin is distinctly different than Custom UI Themes. 

> **note** Custom UI Themes are available beginning in version **2019.1**.
