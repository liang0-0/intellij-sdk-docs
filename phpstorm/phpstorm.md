title: PhpStorm Plugin Development

### Development and Testing Tools
Plugins for PhpStorm are developed in Java using either edition of IntelliJ IDEA. The Community Edition of IntelliJ IDEA can
be used for developing, but not testing, a PhpStorm plugin. Although IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition (with the PHP plugin) can be 
used for testing PhpStorm plugins, the recommended approach is to use PhpStorm for testing.

The [PsiViewer plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/227-psiviewer) is also recommended.

### PhpStorm Specifics

* [Setting-up the environment](setting_up_environment.md)
* [PHP Open API](php_open_api.md)
* [Example Third Party PhpStorm plugins](existing_plugins.md)
